## Technical Notes

* The extension uses `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` to request sarcasm predictions from a background script or a pre-existing ML backend server.
* Detection runs by monitoring the DOM with a `MutationObserver`.
* Text is retrieved from the selector `.content-area.--body1 .--ltr` according to the current Argilla web structure.
* Detection result labels are `1` (sarcastic) or `0` (not sarcastic).
* Checkboxes with `name="1"` or `name="0"` are selected according to the label.
* Detection history is stored in browser `localStorage`.
* Additional UI includes pause and show/hide history buttons fixed on the page.

## Development

If you want to customize or extend the extension:

* Update the text selector if Argilla‚Äôs DOM structure changes.
* Adjust message sending and response handling with the background script.
* Add validation and error handling as needed.
